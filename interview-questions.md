# UNIT 4: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely on your own, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. Compare and contrast JavaScript and Ruby. What are three things they have in common and what are three differences?

Similarities

1.
// Both are OOP (object oriented programs)
2.
// Both can be used for Back-end development depending on what framework is being used.
3.
// Both are concurrent which allow asynchronous programming and allows callbacks. 

Differences

1.
// Javascript is executed by web browsers for client side scripts using Node.js to run it
while Ruby uses a Ruby interpreter.
2.
// Ruby has variables that references to objects, while in Javascript variables hold primitive values.

3.
// Ruby has more flexible and concise syntax with {}, while Javascript has a C-style syntax for their {} and uses semicolons to terminate statements.

Researched answer:
//  Both are object-oriented languages, and both can run on the fly without being compiled into machine code before being able to run.
// JavaScript can be used for both front or back end, but Ruby is reserved for back end only

2. What does it mean to implement a TDD workflow?

Your answer:
// Test Driven Development is like a blueprint before writing the real code.

Researched answer:

3. What is a block in Ruby?

// Blocks are used to make code reusable again.

Researched answer:
// It is Ruby's version of closures and make it more reusable and less verbose

4. STRETCH: What is a version manager?
